# 🏠 SwissHome Rush: The All-in-One Relocation Platform

## 🇨🇭 Why I Built This

I started this project to solve real-world problems I encountered while living in Switzerland—specifically the challenges of moving and commuting via SBB. I wanted to turn these daily needs into a functional service.

This roadmap represents my growth as a developer. It serves as a comprehensive study of **FastAPI** and system design, paving the way for my future transition into **C# .NET** development.

**SwissHome Rush** is a comprehensive backend development roadmap designed to solve the challenges of moving to Switzerland. The project evolves from basic data management to handling high-concurrency "viewing slot wars," mirroring real-world enterprise system complexities.

This repository serves as a playground for mastering **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **Asynchronous Programming**, and **System Architecture**.

## 📂 Completed Modules

### ✅ Stage 1: The Relocation Checklist
* **Goal**: "Give the server a memory."
* **Description**: A task management API to organize relocation to-dos (documents, cleaning, packing).
* **Key Tech**:
    * **JWT Authentication**: Secure signup/login (Users manage their own lists).
    * **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete checklist items.
    * **Database**: SQLite (Moving to PostgreSQL in Stage 4).

### ✅ Stage 2: Rent Affordability Calculator
* **Goal**: "Implement Swiss property laws in code."
* **Description**: A logic-heavy service that calculates estimated net income and validates rent against the Swiss "1/3 Affordability Rule."
* **Key Tech**:
    * **Service Layer Pattern**: Separating business logic from API routers.
    * **Canton-Specific Logic**: Dynamic tax/deduction estimation for ZH, BE, GE, GR.
    * **Jinja2 Templating**: Server-side rendering for a quick interactive UI.
